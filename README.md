helm-docs
=========
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)

This is a fork from [norwoodj/helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs.git)

The helm-docs tool generates automatic documentation from helm charts into a markdown file. The resulting
file contains metadata about the chart and a table with all of your charts' values, their defaults, and an
optional description parsed from comments.

The markdown generation is entirely [gotemplate](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template) driven. The tool parses metadata
from charts and generates a number of sub-templates that can be referenced in a template file (by default `README.md.gotmpl`).
If no template file is provided, the tool has a default internal template that will generate a reasonably formatted README.


## Installation
helm-docs can be installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install norwoodj/tap/helm-docs
```

This will download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs/releases/latest)
of the tool.

To build from source in this repository:

```bash
cd cmd/helm-docs
go build
```


## Usage

## Using binary directly

To run and generate documentation into READMEs for all helm charts within or recursively contained by a directory:

```bash
helm-docs
# OR
helm-docs --dry-run # prints generated documentation to stdout rather than modifying READMEs
```

The tool searches recursively through subdirectories of the current directory for `Chart.yaml` files and generates documentation
for every chart that it finds.

## Using docker

You can mount directory with charts under `/helm-docs` within container.

Print generated documentation to stdout rather than modifying READMEs:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/helm-docs" -u $(id -u) jnorwood/helm-docs:latest --dry-run
```

Overwrite READMEs within mounted directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/helm-docs" -u $(id -u) jnorwood/helm-docs:latest
```

# Building from source

Notice that you need to have build chain toolkit for given platform and golang installed.
Next you may need to export some vars to build standalone, non-linked binary for given platform and architecture:

```bash
export CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
make clean
make fmt
make test
make
```

## Available Templates
The templates generated by the tool are shown below, and can be included in your `README.md.gotmpl` file like so:
```
{{ template "template-name" . }}
```

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| chart.header              | The main heading of the generated markdown file |
| chart.deprecationWarning  | A deprecation warning which is displayed when the _deprecated_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file is `true` |
| chart.description         | A description line containing the _description_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file, or "" if that field is not set |
| chart.version             | The _version_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file |
| chart.versionLine         | A text line stating the current version of the chart |
| chart.versionBadge        | A badge stating the current version of the chart |
| chart.type                | The _type_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file |
| chart.typeLine            | A text line stating the current type of the chart |
| chart.typeBadge           | A badge stating the current type of the chart |
| chart.appVersion          | The _appVersion_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file |
| chart.appVersionLine      | A text line stating the current appVersion of the chart |
| chart.appVersionBadge     | A badge stating the current appVersion of the chart |
| chart.homepage            | The _home_ link from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file, or "" if that field is not set |
| chart.homepageLine        | A text line stating the current homepage of the chart |
| chart.maintainersHeader   | The heading for the chart maintainers section |
| chart.maintainersTable    | A table of the chart's maintainers |
| chart.maintainersSection  | A section headed by the maintainersHeader from above containing the maintainersTable from above or "" if there are no maintainers |
| chart.sourcesHeader       | The heading for the chart sources section |
| chart.sourcesList         | A list of the chart's sources |
| chart.sourcesSection      | A section headed by the sourcesHeader from above containing the sourcesList from above or "" if there are no sources |
| chart.kubeVersion         | The _kubeVersion_ field from the chart's `Chart.yaml` file |
| chart.kubeVersionLine     | A text line stating the required Kubernetes version for the chart |~~~~
| chart.requirementsHeader  | The heading for the chart requirements section |
| chart.requirementsTable   | A table of the chart's required sub-charts |
| chart.requirementsSection | A section headed by the requirementsHeader from above containing the kubeVersionLine and/or the requirementsTable from above or "" if there are no requirements |
| chart.valuesHeader        | The heading for the chart values section |
| chart.valuesTable         | A table of the chart's values parsed from the `values.yaml` file (see below) |
| chart.valuesSection       | A section headed by the valuesHeader from above containing the valuesTable from above or "" if there are no values |

For an example of how these various templates can be used in a `README.md.gotmpl` file to generate a reasonable markdown file,
look at the charts in [example-charts](./example-charts).

If there is no `README.md.gotmpl` (or other specified gotmpl file) present, the default template is used to generate the README.
That template looks like so:
```
{{ template "chart.header" . }}
{{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

{{ template "chart.versionBadge" . }}{{ template "chart.typeBadge" . }}{{ template "chart.appVersionBadge" . }}

{{ template "chart.description" . }}

{{ template "chart.homepageLine" . }}

{{ template "chart.maintainersSection" . }}

{{ template "chart.sourcesSection" . }}

{{ template "chart.requirementsSection" . }}

{{ template "chart.valuesSection" . }}
```

The tool includes the [sprig templating library](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), so those functions can be used
in the templates you supply.


## Ignoring Chart Directories
helm-docs supports a `.helmdocsignore` file, exactly like a `.gitignore` file in which one can specify directories to ignore
when searching for charts. Directories specified need not be charts themselves, so parent directories containing potentially
many charts can be ignored and none of the charts underneath them will be processed. You may also directly reference the
Chart.yaml file for a chart to skip processing for it.


## values.yaml metadata
This tool can parse descriptions and defaults of values from `values.yaml` files. The defaults are pulled directly from
the yaml in the file. Descriptions can be added for parameters by specifying the full path of the value and
a particular comment format. I invite you to check out the [example-charts](./example-charts) to see how this is done in
practice. In order to add a description for a parameter you need only put a comment somewhere in the file of the format:

```yaml
controller:
  publishService:
    # controller.publishService.enabled -- Whether to expose the ingress controller to the public world
    enabled: false

  # controller.replicas -- Number of nginx-ingress pods to load balance between.
  # Do not set this below 2.
  replicas: 2
```

Note that comments can continue on the next line. In that case leave out the double dash, and the lines will simply be
appended with a space in-between.

The following rules are used to determine which values will be added to the values table in the README:

* By default, only _leaf nodes_, that is, fields of type `int`, `string`, `float`, `bool`, empty lists, and empty maps
  are added as rows in the values table. These fields will be added even if they do not have a description comment
* Lists and maps which contain elements will not be added as rows in the values table _unless_ they have a description
  comment which refers to them
* Adding a description comment for a non-empty list or map in this way makes it so that leaf nodes underneath the
  described field will _not_ be automatically added to the values table. In order to document both a non-empty list/map
  _and_ a leaf node within that field, description comments must be added for both

e.g. In this case, both `controller.livenessProbe` and `controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path` will be added as rows in
the values table, but `controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.port` will not
```yaml
controller:
  # controller.livenessProbe -- Configure the healthcheck for the ingress controller
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      # controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path -- This is the liveness check endpoint
      path: /healthz
      port: http
```

Results in:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| controller.livenessProbe | object | `{"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":8080}}` | Configure the healthcheck for the ingress controller |
| controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path | string | `"/healthz"` | This is the liveness check endpoint |

If we remove the comment for `controller.livenessProbe` however, both leaf nodes `controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path`
and `controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.port` will be added to the table, with our without description comments:

```yaml
controller:
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      # controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path -- This is the liveness check endpoint
      path: /healthz
      port: http
```

Results in:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.path | string | `"/healthz"` | This is the liveness check endpoint |
| controller.livenessProbe.httpGet.port | string | `"http"` | |


### nil values
If you would like to define a key for a value, but leave the default empty, you can still specify a description for it
as well as a type. Like so:
```yaml
controller:
  # controller.replicas -- (int) Number of nginx-ingress pods to load balance between
  replicas:
```
This could be useful when wanting to enforce user-defined values for the chart, where there are no sensible defaults.

### Default values/column
In cases where you do not want to include the default value from `values.yaml`, or where the real default is calculated
inside the chart, you can change the contents of the column like so:

```yaml
service:
  # service.annotations -- Add annotations to the service
  # @default -- the chart will add some internal annotations automatically
  annotations: []
```

The order is important. The name must be spelled just like the column heading. The first comment must be the
one specifying the key. The "@default" comment must follow.

See [here](./example-charts/custom-template/values.yaml) for an example.

### Spaces and Dots in keys
If a key name contains any "." or " " characters, that section of the path must be quoted in description comments e.g.

```yaml
service:
  annotations:
    # service.annotations."external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname" -- Hostname to be assigned to the ELB for the service
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: stupidchess.jmn23.com

configMap:
  # configMap."not real config param" -- A completely fake config parameter for a useful example
  not real config param: value
```

## Pre-commit hook

If you want to automatically generate `README.md` files with a pre-commit hook, make sure you
[install the pre-commit binary](https://pre-commit.com/#install), and add a [.pre-commit-config.yaml file](./.pre-commit-config.yaml)
to your project. Then run:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install-hooks
```

Future changes to your charts requirements.yaml, values.yaml, or Chart.yaml files will cause an update to documentation when
you commit.
